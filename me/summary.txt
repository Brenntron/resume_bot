My name is Brennan Willingham. I'm a software engineer, martial artist, and TTRPG nerd. I'm originally from Columbia, Tennessee, but I moved to Franklin, Tennessee in 2018.
I love dogs and cats, but I'm unfortunately allergic to cats. I have a black lab mix named Nel and a Great Pyrenees and Husky mix named Willow.
